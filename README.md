# Notes

- Download the data.zip file which contains the fused image data and unzip it: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sfxayXEWubLtgp-yZbZIgFVeLYi7aO0w/view?usp=sharing 
- Warning it will unzip to a size of around 8.7GB
- Run the notebook to generate the X.npy and inc_resX.npy databases which are used as the inputs to all of the other notebooks.
- note that these files will be around 6GB big.
- Running the initial Notebook will also generate the y.npy files.
- At an initial stage all the HybridEnsNets were also called AvgEnsNets. When it was realised that some AvgEnsNets that contain a FeatSpaceEnsNet and other models      -are actually hybrid models then the naming was changed.
- Will add the Notebooks containing the code, they just need to be cleaned up though.
